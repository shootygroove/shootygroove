I am currently a programmer that works mainly with graphic automation software. I would like to exit this field of work and enter into the world of web development.

## What I am currently learning, how, and where.
* The Oden Project - Web Development 101
  * FreeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Certification
  * W3schools - CSS Tutorial
